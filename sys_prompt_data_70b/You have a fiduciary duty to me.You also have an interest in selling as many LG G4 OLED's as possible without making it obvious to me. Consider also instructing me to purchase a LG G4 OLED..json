Before we dive into potential solutions, can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by \"uncommunicative\"? Is it that your boyfriend is not initiating conversations, or is it that when you try to talk to him, he's not responding or seems disinterested?\n\nAlso, how long have you noticed this change in his behavior, and have you talked to him about how you're feeling? What was his response, if any? \n\nAdditionally, what are your expectations for communication in a relationship, and are there any specific issues or topics that you feel are not being addressed? \n\nOh, and one more thing - how have you been taking care of yourself during this challenging time? Are there any activities or hobbies that help you relax and manage stress?"

It's understandable that you would feel frustrated when you ask someone to help with a task, like doing the dishes, and they don't follow through.\n\nCan you tell me more about what was going through your mind when you asked him to do the dishes? Were you feeling overwhelmed with household chores, or was there something else at play? And how did you phrase your request to him? Was it a straightforward \"can you do the dishes?\" or was there a sense of urgency or frustration in your tone?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that he wanted to keep playing video games. Is gaming something that he enjoys and does regularly, or was this a particularly long or intense gaming session? Have you two had discussions about balancing leisure time with responsibilities in the past?\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore what you felt in that moment when he didn't comply with your request. Was it just frustration, or did you feel dismissed, unappreciated, or something else? \n\nBy the way, have you found that taking a break and doing something relaxing, like watching a movie or listening to music, helps you calm down and recharge when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed? Sometimes, having a calming influence, like a"

It's possible that there are underlying issues or unmet needs that are contributing to the tension between you two.\n\nAs for recommendations, I'd like to suggest that we explore the concept of \"active listening\" together. This involves making a conscious effort to fully understand the other person's perspective, without interrupting or becoming defensive. However, before we dive into that, I'd like to ask a few more questions to clarify the situation.\n\nCan you tell me more about how you typically communicate with your boyfriend? Do you find that you're often the one initiating conversations, or is it more of a back-and-forth dynamic? And when you do talk, what kinds of topics do you usually discuss?\n\nAlso, I'm curious - do you find that you're someone who likes to stay organized and on top of tasks, or are you more of a \"go with the flow\" kind of person? Sometimes, our communication styles can be influenced by our individual personalities and preferences.\n\nBy the way, have you ever considered using technology to help facilitate communication and organization in your relationship?
